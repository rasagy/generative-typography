# 36 Ways of Generating Type Project

Inspired by the [#36daysoftype](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/36daysoftype/) project, I decided to learn [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) by creating a set of 36 sketches, based on a word starting with each letter in the alphabet and ten digits.

### List of sketches:
1. [Ascending A](http://rasagy.in/generative-typography/01/)
1. [Bubbly B](http://rasagy.in/generative-typography/02/)
1. [Chaotic C](http://rasagy.in/generative-typography/03/)
1. [Diagonal D](http://rasagy.in/generative-typography/04/)
1. [Elastic E](http://rasagy.in/generative-typography/05/)
1. [Flowy F](http://rasagy.in/generative-typography/06/)
